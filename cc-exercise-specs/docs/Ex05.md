# Train Watch - Ex05
# CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) or
# READ (Retrieve, Edit, Add, Delete) Operations

> **This set of exercises is cumulative**; future exercises in this series will build upon previous exercises.

## Overview

A key aspect of this site is to allow users not only to search the database to find information on various rail cars, but also to allow users to add new rail cars to the database, update rail car information in the database, and delete rail cars from the database. Your task in this exercise is to provide that functionality.

Use the demos presented in class as a guide to implementing this exercise.

### `Watch the recording that demonstrates the running solution for this exercise.`

### Create the HTML needed for the Crud side of the QueryCrud Page

Create the HTML form elements needed to display every data point for one record from the RollingStock database table. Place these elements on the Crud side of the QueryCrud Page.

Create a `Add`, `Update`, `Delete`, and `Clear` button at the bottom of the Crud side of the QueryCrud page.

Create an area below the buttons on the Crud side of the QueryCrud page where `Success` and `Error` messages can be displayed.

### Modify the Query Results Table (left side of the QueryCrud Page)

Add a new colum with `Edit` buttons as shown below in the query results table:

|Action| Reporting Mark | Owner               | Rail Car Type     | InService |
|------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
|Edit  | BN 19117       | Burlington Northern | Open-Top Hopper   | True
|Edit  | BN 95782       | Burlington Northern | Open-Top Hopper   | True
|Edit  | BN 95831       | Burlington Northern | Open-Top Hopper   | True
|Edit  | BN 95887       | Burlington Northern | Open-Top Hopper   | True
|Edit  | BN 95914       | Burlington Northern | Open-Top Hopper   | True

Each `Edit` button when pressed will result in a method call to the `Retrieve` method in the BackEnd `RollingStockServices` class.

### Create the Code to Complete the CRUD/READ Functionality for this Exercise

In the `RollingStockServices` class add the following method:

```csharp
public RollingStockItem Retrieve(string reportingMark)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"RollingStockServices: Retrieve; reportingMark= {reportingMark}");
  var info = 
    Context.RollingStocks
    .Where(x => x.ReportingMark == reportingMark)
    .Select(x => new RollingStockItem
    {
      ReportingMark = x.ReportingMark,
      Owner = x.Owner,
      LightWeight = x.LightWeight,
      LoadLimit = x.LoadLimit,
      Capacity = x.Capacity,
      RailCarTypeId = x.RailCarTypeId,
      YearBuilt = x.YearBuilt,
      InService = x.InService,
      Notes = x.Notes
    }).FirstOrDefault();
    Console.WriteLine($"End");
  return info;
}
```

Modify the FrontEnd `OnPost()` method to call the BackEnd `Retrieve` method when any of the `Edit` buttons are pressed in the first colum of the query results table.

In the `RollingStockServices` class add the following method:

```csharp
public void Edit(RollingStockItem item)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"RollingStockServices: Edit; ReportingMark= {item.ReportingMark}");

  //BLL Validation for non existing rolling stock
  RollingStock existing = Context.RollingStocks.Find(item.ReportingMark);
    if (existing == null)
      throw new Exception("Rolling Stock does not exist");

  existing.ReportingMark = item.ReportingMark;
  existing.Owner = item.Owner;
  existing.LightWeight = item.LightWeight;
  existing.LoadLimit = item.LoadLimit;
  existing.Capacity = item.Capacity;
  existing.RailCarTypeId = item.RailCarTypeId;
  existing.YearBuilt = item.YearBuilt;
  existing.InService = item.InService;
  existing.Notes = item.Notes;

  EntityEntry<RollingStock> updating = Context.Entry(existing);
  updating.State = Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.EntityState.Modified;
  Context.SaveChanges();
}
```

Modify the FrontEnd `OnPost()` method to call the BackEnd `Edit` method when the `Update` button is pressed on the QueryCrud Page. `Validation` must be performed in the code behind of the FrontEnd, and must pass, before the `Edit` method in the BackEnd can be called. If validation fails, Aggregate Exceptions must be thrown. 

In the `RollingStockServices` class add the following method:

```csharp
public void Add(RollingStockItem item)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"RollingStockServices: Add; reportingMark= {item.ReportingMark}");

  //BLL Validation for no rolling stock duplicates
  var exists = 
    Context.RollingStocks.FirstOrDefault(x => 
    x.ReportingMark == item.ReportingMark);
  if (exists != null)
    throw new Exception("A rolling stock with the same reporting mark already exists");

  var newRollingStock = new RollingStock();
  newRollingStock.ReportingMark = item.ReportingMark;
  newRollingStock.Owner = item.Owner;
  newRollingStock.LightWeight = item.LightWeight;
  newRollingStock.LoadLimit = item.LoadLimit;
  newRollingStock.Capacity = item.Capacity;
  newRollingStock.RailCarTypeId = item.RailCarTypeId;
  newRollingStock.YearBuilt = item.YearBuilt;
  newRollingStock.InService = item.InService;
  newRollingStock.Notes = item.Notes;

  Context.RollingStocks.Add(newRollingStock);
  Context.SaveChanges();
}
```

Modify the FrontEnd `OnPost()` method to call the BackEnd `Add` method when the `Add` button is pressed on the QueryCrud Page. `Validation` must be performed in the code behind of the FrontEnd, and must pass, before the `Add` method in the BackEnd can be called. If validation fails, Aggregate Exceptions must be thrown.

In the `RollingStockServices` class add the following method:

```csharp
public void Delete(RollingStockItem item)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"RollingStockServices: Delete; reportingMark= {item.ReportingMark}");

  //BLL Validation
  RollingStock existing = Context.RollingStocks.Find(item.ReportingMark);
    if (existing == null)
      throw new Exception("Rolling Stock does not exist");

  EntityEntry<RollingStock> removing = Context.Entry(existing);
  removing.State = Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.EntityState.Deleted;
  Context.SaveChanges();
}
```

Modify the FrontEnd `OnPost()` method to call the BackEnd `Delete` method when the `Delete` button is pressed on the QueryCrud Page.

Modify the FrontEnd `OnPost()` method to clear all data fields when the `Clear` button is pressed on the QueryCrud Page.
