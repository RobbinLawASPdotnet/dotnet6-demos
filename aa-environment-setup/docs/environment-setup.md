## Download Git

- [Git Website](https://git-scm.com/)

- Download the latest version. Allow all the defaults on download. The path should be updated automatically, so that `git` is available from any directory.
- Open a PowerShell or CMD terminal. In the shell run `git â€“version` to make sure that git is installed and accessible from this directory. Note that it is two minus bars before version. If a version number is not returned, the path must be set so that `git` is available from any directory. To set the path, in the search area at the bottom of the windows task bar type `env` and select `Edit Environment Variables for your Account`. Then edit the `PATH` and add new `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd`. You could add this to the system environments alternatively. Now you can run the `git` command from a terminal anywhere.
